# chess-trainer-bot

A simple chess bot for [lichess.org](https://lichess.org) that responds to game events and plays moves using Stockfish and the lichess opening explorer. The bot will try to match the opponent's rating so that you always get a fair game.

## Setup

1. **Install Stockfish 16 and Python dependencies**
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```
   The script uses `apt-get` to install Stockfish 16 (via the `stockfish` package) and then installs the Python requirements listed in `requirements.txt`.

2. **Configure your environment**
   Copy `.env_example` to `.env` and replace the token value with your lichess bot token.
   ```bash
   cp .env_example .env
   # edit .env and set LICHESS_BOT_TOKEN
   ```

## Running the bot

Execute the main training script:

```bash
python trainer.py
```

You will be prompted to choose preferred openings and the bot will start listening for games on lichess. Moves will be selected from the lichess opening explorer when possible and otherwise generated by Stockfish 16.

## Files

- `trainer.py` – main entry point that handles lichess events and engine interaction.
- `openings_explorer.py` – helper module that queries the lichess opening explorer and filters moves by your preferences.
- `setup.sh` – installs Stockfish 16 and the required Python packages.

Enjoy your training games!

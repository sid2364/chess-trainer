# Chess Trainer Bot

A simple chess bot for [lichess.org](https://lichess.org) that responds to game events and plays moves using Stockfish and the lichess opening explorer. The bot will try to match the opponent's rating so that you always get a fair game.

## Setup

1. **Install Stockfish 16 and Python dependencies**
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```
   The script uses `apt-get` to install Stockfish 16 (via the `stockfish` package) and then installs the Python requirements listed in `requirements.txt`.

2. **Configure your environment**
   Copy `.env_example` to `.env` and replace the token value with your Lichess bot token.
   
   Note: You will need to create a Lichess BOT account first, see instructions here: https://lichess.org/api#tag/Bot/operation/botAccountUpgrade
   ```bash
   cp .env_example .env
   # edit .env and set LICHESS_BOT_TOKEN
   ```
## Running the bot

Execute the package as a module:

```bash
python -m chess_trainer.trainer
```

You will be prompted to choose preferred openings and the bot will start listening for games on Lichess. Moves will be selected from the Lichess opening explorer when possible and otherwise generated by Stockfish 16.

### Web setup

If you prefer a small web UI instead of the command line prompts run:

```bash
python -m chess_trainer.frontend
```

Your browser will open `http://localhost:8000/` where you can pick your preferred openings and enter the username you wish to challenge. After the challenge is accepted the Lichess game page will open automatically.
